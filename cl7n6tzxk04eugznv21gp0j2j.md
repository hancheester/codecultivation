## How to mock ASP.NET Core Identity?

I was having a bit of issue when I tried to test my class which needs `UserManager<ApplicationUser>` object and `RoleManager<IdentityRole>` object in constructor method. Both classes are from new membership system called ASP.NET Core Identity. You can learn more from [Introduction to Identity on ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity)

When I first googled for my problem, some people use Fake class to test their method which results with more classes in unit test project to maintain. I rather try to avoid that.

The solution that I have used [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4) for .NET mocking framework. Without creating fake class, I can instantiate a Mock object by passing in mocked arguments into the intended type contructor method.

Please see example below:
```csharp
    var mockUserManager = new Mock>(
                         new Mock>().Object,
                         new Mock>().Object,
                         new Mock>().Object,
                         new IUserValidator[0],
                         new IPasswordValidator[0],
                         new Mock().Object,
                         new Mock().Object,
                         new Mock().Object,
                         new Mock>>().Object);
     return mockUserManager.Object;

    var mockRoleManager = new Mock>(
                         new Mock>().Object,
                         new IRoleValidator[0],
                         new Mock().Object,
                         new Mock().Object,
                         new Mock>>().Object);
     return mockRoleManager.Object;
```

As observed above, ASP.NET Identityâ€™s `UserManager<TUser>` takes quite a number of parameters if you look at the class definition. And there is no parameterless constructor in `UserManager<TUser>`, otherwise, you will have an error message saying _Could not find a parameterless constructor._ like I did when trying to instantiate this class without constructor parameters. By the way, I was using [Castle Windsor](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/windsor/) for Inversion of Control (IOC) container for my unit testing project for injecting required arguments into contructor methods.

So by using Mocked object from Moq, I would be able to use `Mock<UserManager<TUser>().Setup(x => ...).Return(...)` in all my test methods.
